Now, from smaller to bigger, you could use, oh, another one more, you can do one by one in this case, you could use what? We just discussed, what? That's it. Upsampling is, what kind of operation? You have computer 2D inside, you have? Decommissioned. Decommissioned, it is so-called transport, to be right, computer 2D. So exactly, so now it's like, upsampling commotionally, you use a two by two layer, so that you can do bigger, and in this case, you can concatenate with left to the right, because exactly, they have similar chip size.

First of all, we have like a four-dumpling, down-dumping, and you have like, on the eight commotion layers, and similarly, in the decoder part, you have four up sampling, and you also have another eight around like, transports commotion layers. And then here is some advantages of unit, and it is a perfect symmetric network structure, and the decommotion parts, the commotion can improve the feature period, and the skip connections uses the way of concatenate. And then there are some, several, disadvantages, for example, the commotion adapts commotion kernels with fixed geometry structure, and the fixed of perceptron field loses some global information, so the skip connection is simple, but it can be improved, and this model, its kernel size, is kind of large. But it is not as large as the previous FC model, it still depends on, so this is just, you can compare here, FC then, you have like, 220, and then you have like, 6 megabytes, but unit, you only have 51 megabytes.
