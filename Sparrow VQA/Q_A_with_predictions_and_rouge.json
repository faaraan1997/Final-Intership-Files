        "Original_Answer": "The IoU (Intersection over Union) threshold in non-max suppression is important because it sets the criterion for deciding whether overlapping bounding boxes are considered the same object. A higher IoU threshold requires a greater overlap for a box to be suppressed, which can lead to fewer detections being eliminated and potentially more duplicates in the output. Conversely, a lower IoU threshold results in more aggressive suppression of overlapping boxes, which might reduce duplicates but also increase the risk of missing valid detections. This threshold balances detection accuracy and the number of detections.",
        "Predicted_Answer": "The IoU threshold is important in non-max suppression because it determines how closely overlapping bounding boxes are considered. Bounding boxes with IoU above the threshold are suppressed to avoid duplicating detections and improve the precision of the final detections.",
