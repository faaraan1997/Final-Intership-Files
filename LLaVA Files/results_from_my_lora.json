What kind of layer you needed to use in this part? What kind of layer? What kind of layer? Now, from smaller to bigger, you could use, oh, another one more, you can do one by one in this case, you could use what? We just discussed, what? That's it. Upsampling is, what kind of operation? You have computer 2D inside, you have? Decommissioned. Decommissioned, it is so-called transport, to be right, computer 2D. So exactly, so now it's like, upsampling commotionally, you use a two by two layer, so that you can do bigger, and in this case, you can concatenate with left to the right, because exactly, they have similar chip size. And similar, once you go bigger and bigger, so you can, so you can also try to concatenate the features from your encoder to your decoder part, right? From left to right, from left to right. So in this case, you can get some output, so here, output map, so here, if you have the two classes, there should be a background and a foreground. And this part is called contraction, so increase what, and reduce where, and this part is called expansion, so basically, you want to, you create a higher resolution segmentation map, so that it has some size as original input image. Any question about this part? So now, in the future, you should notice about unit more, right? Correct. But here is another realization of the unit. First of all, we have like a four-dumpling, down-dumping, and you have like, on the eight commotion layers, and similarly, in the decoder part, you have four up sampling, and you also have another eight around like, transports commotion layers. And then here is some advantages of unit, and it is a perfect symmetric network structure, and the decommotion parts, the commotion can improve the feature period, and the skip connections uses the way of concatenate. And then there are some, several, disadvantages, for example, the commotion adapts commotion kernels with fixed geometry structure, and the fixed of perceptron field loses some global information, so the skip connection is simple, but it can be improved, and this model, its kernel size, is kind of large. But it is not as large as the previous FC model, it still depends on, so this is just, you can compare here, FC then, you have like, 220, and then you have like, 6 megabytes, but unit, you only have 51 megabytes. So definitely you will prefer FCM, but then, you prefer the unit than FC model, in terms of its storage, right?",

Think about it is here and the Right Entinter, which means, Let's have a look at this are the parent functions. about project three, yes? I want to. I want to watch it? Okay, hopefully you can get it, okay. And this part, once you apply several commuter layers, so you can get a smaller kind of feature size here, you have first got a 570, 570, then you have a 568 by 568. Accordingly, you should be like this way, it's just about some typical commuter layers you can apply there. And then you can basically calculate the output of this size, using some of these kind of equations that we discussed previously about this field size, some padding, some stride, blah, blah, you can calculate the output of each layer. So next, you will have another bunch of several layers after that, so that you can keep going down, so this should be 128 by 128, and then you have 256 by 256, then you can have this 512 by 512. So eventually you will have a size, as this part is around 1,024, as the minimum feature size, right? So you will have this feature size, 1,024.
