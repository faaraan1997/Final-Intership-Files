And there's a term I'll refer as the p(x) here, just, we can also name it as a prior probability or the initial degree of of x. And he has, p x y is a posterior probability. That degree of We we live after the incorporation of knowledge of y and the p y x is so called the likelihood of the y given x, and the p y here is just the evidence. And, eventually, the is just, can be understand in this way. So later, once we Try to estimate something we were trying to reuse this likelihood. It was kind of prior"

However, usually, it is our continuous random variable facts that we are being calculated using some hidden indication here. Right? So when the identity of the distribution is clear around the response, we can write, you know, as this kind of explanation here. So if it is clear with random variable, it's used, and we can write just write it as the expectation of. So b is the most common matter of central tendency of a distribution for a random variable f(x) So I is equal to f(x). That means that mu is equal to the expectation of x I. Then can be plus or rewrite at this point. As this signal, I just missed that you get well, categorize the average of all the samples xi. Right? Other measures of central tendency, Like, for example, like a medium or a techno mode of the data."

These scenarios involve random and independent events occurring at a consistent average rate, making them suitable for modeling using the Poisson distribution."

The Poisson distribution is used to model the number of events that occur independently within a fixed interval of time or space, given a known average rate of occurrence 'lambda'. It is characterized by a single parameter 'lambda'. On the other hand, the Binomial distribution is used to model the number of successes in a fixed number of independent trials, each with the same probability of success 'p'. It is characterized by two parameters: the number of trials 'n' and the probability of success 'p'. While both distributions deal with counting events, the Poisson distribution focuses on events occurring over a fixed interval, whereas the Binomial distribution focuses on a fixed number of trials."

It indicates the average number of events that are expected to occur in the given interval. For example, if 'lambda' is 3, it means that on average, 3 events are expected to occur in the interval. The value of 'lambda' must be positive, as it represents a rate, and it determines the shape and characteristics of the Poisson distribution. A higher value of 'lambda' corresponds to a greater average rate of occurrence, while a lower value of 'lambda' corresponds to a lower average rate of occurrence."

It's best to  will calculate all the event x across across all the small x, p(x), for example, p at probability of p(x) that times with log of p(x). So if x is a continuous random variable that follows a probability distribution p here was a probated. That's the function p(x) for the at the attributes. So now in this case, it should So we we have identification in this case. Right? And, for continuous random variables, the entropy is also called the differential entropy. And the for those the entropy is also very important, and, as a machine learning model, especially for the neural network, it is very important."

I know. And guess from you? So you're getting the the sum of the diagonals or this is called? Yes. That's correct. So, Actually, it's just a 50 plus 68 then divide the sum of all that. You take the the diagonal elements then divide the all that together as an accurate. That's it. Good. So, another use for directions is trying to measure some other metrics such as the precision. That means that true positive divide by the, true positive plus or false positive. And, also, you can calculate another one that says, recall recall has just equal to the true Positive divide by the true positive plus the flase positive."

That is mapping from x to y, and the way x should be a vector of real a very the features from x, man, to x end, And the y case, what it function is is just 0 or is just 1. So assume our x I are conditional independent in a given y, and the model xi depends on the given y, is equal to y k as a function. Is this one. Right?

So here is the overall representations of the logistic regression hypothesis, And we have this, like, at theta_1, theta_1 to theta_n and x_n here. Right? So you're wondering this problem. How we can get this kind of functions here? So let's try to consider value from a function f. That is mapping from x to y, and the way x should be a vector of real a very the features from x, man, to x end, And the y case, what it function is is just 0 or is just 1. So assume our x I are conditional independent in a given y, and the model xi depends on the given y, is equal to y k as a function. Is this one. Right? And we also try to model p y, the probability of y, that's only function as pi. When I use p y is equal to pi. Right. So let's say it was going on about the probability of y giving x, y, and q to x n."

Subsequently, each data point is centered at zero by subtracting the sample mean from it. This step ensures that the dataset is normalized around zero, facilitating further analysis. Following centering, the sample covariance matrix is calculated to capture the variability and relationships between different features. Eigen decomposition is then performed on this covariance matrix, yielding eigenvectors and eigenvalues. The top k eigenvectors, corresponding to the largest eigenvalues, are selected to form the principal components. Finally, the centered data is projected onto these principal components, resulting in a lower-dimensional representation of the dataset while retaining as much variance as possible. These steps collectively enable PCA to effectively identify and extract meaningful patterns from high-dimensional datasets, aiding in data analysis and interpretation."

These eigenvalues represent the magnitude of variance along the corresponding eigenvectors, which represent the directions of maximum variance in the dataset. The most significant components are typically prioritized by arranging the eigenvalues in decreasing order. Since the covariance matrix is symmetric, its eigenvectors form an orthogonal basis in the original feature space, allowing any data point (x) to be represented as a linear combination of the eigenvectors: x = \u03a3(yi\u03c5i), where yi is the coefficient for each eigenvector. Additionally, normalizing the eigenvectors to unit length (|\u03c5| = 1) simplifies calculations and ensures consistency across implementations, aiding in the interpretation of each component's importance in explaining dataset variance."

The eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis, satisfying the condition u^T*u = \u03b4_ij. The SVD can also be expressed as eigenvalue decompositions of the covariance matrices of the data, offering insights into the structure and variability of the dataset. This decomposition relates closely to eigenvalue decomposition, where the eigenvectors of xx^T and x^Tx are equivalent to U and V, respectively, while the singular values correspond to the square root of the eigenvalues.

Firstly, we calculate the sample covariance matrix \u03a3 using the formula \u03a3 = (1/M) \u03a3(x - \u03bc)(x - \u03bc)^T, where M is the number of data points and \u03bc is the sample mean. The resulting covariance matrix is \u03a3 = [[6.25, 4.25], [4.25, 3.5]].Next, we compute the eigenvalues by solving the characteristic polynomial equation \u03a3\u03c7\u03c5 = \u03bb\u03c5, where \u03bb represents the eigenvalues. Substituting the values from the covariance matrix, we obtain the characteristic equation as (16.25 - \u03bb)(3.5 - \u03bb) - (4.25)^2 = 0. Solving this equation yields the eigenvalues \u03bb\u2081 \u2248 9.34 and \u03bb\u2082 \u2248 0.41. These eigenvalues signify the amount of variance explained by each principal component. In this case, \u03bb\u2081 represents the highest variance, indicating the primary direction of variability in the dataset, while \u03bb\u2082 captures the remaining variance orthogonal to the first principal component. This summary highlights the process of computing PCA for the given dataset, providing insights into its underlying variability and structure."

Mathematically, K is determined by ensuring that the retained variance, represented by the cumulative sum of the eigenvalues up to the Kth component, divided by the total variance (sum of all eigenvalues), exceeds the threshold T. For instance, if T is set to 0.9, it indicates preserving 90% of the variance in the data. If K equals the total number of features (N), it implies retaining 100% of the variance, resulting in no dimensionality reduction.

On the other hand, FA assumes that observed variables are linear combinations of underlying latent factors, plus measurement error.

In PCA, the principal components are orthogonal, while in FA, factors are often allowed to be correlated.

Additionally, clustering provides valuable insights into the underlying structure of the data, revealing hidden patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent. This deeper understanding of data organization enables analysts to make informed decisions and derive meaningful interpretations. Moreover, clustering facilitates the identification of prototypes or representative examples within the dataset, distilling complex information into more manageable summaries. These prototypes serve as essential reference points for understanding the dataset's diversity and identifying key trends or features. Overall, clustering serves as a powerful tool for gaining insights, summarizing data, and facilitating decision-making in various fields of application."

The root of the dendrogram signifies the entire dataset. Importantly, the similarity between two objects is depicted by the height of the lowest internal node they share. A lower shared internal node height implies a higher similarity between the objects.

Notably, the statement There is only one dataset that can be perfectly clustered using a hierarchy suggests that hierarchical clustering may be ideal for datasets with inherent hierarchical structure, as indicated by the orderly arrangement of data points in the dendrogram. This hierarchy allows for the identification of nested clusters, with the similarity between objects represented by the height of shared internal nodes. Overall, hierarchical clustering provides a valuable approach for understanding relationships within datasets and can be particularly effective when analyzing data with hierarchical organization."

The presence of a solitary branch in the dendrogram suggests a data point that is markedly different from the rest. This outlier detection mechanism capitalizes on the visualization of hierarchical clustering to identify anomalous data points that diverge significantly from the typical patterns observed in the dataset. Consequently, the dendrogram provides an intuitive and efficient means of pinpointing outliers, which can be crucial for data quality assessment and anomaly detection tasks."

For instance, with just 5 leaf nodes, there are 34,459,425 potential dendrograms. Given this exponential growth, exhaustive testing of all possible trees becomes impractical. Instead, heuristic methods such as bottom-up (agglomerative) and top-down (divisive) approaches are employed. In the bottom-up method, each item starts in its own cluster, and pairs of clusters are iteratively merged until all clusters combine into one. Conversely, the top-down method begins with all data in a single cluster and recursively divides it into two, selecting the best division at each step. These strategies enable efficient exploration of hierarchical clustering structures, facilitating insightful data analysis."

The objective function aims to minimize this squared error, seeking to find cluster centroids that minimize the overall deviation of data points from their respective centroids. The squared error provides a measure of how well the clusters represent the underlying data distribution, with lower values indicating better clustering performance. By optimizing the objective function, clustering algorithms strive to produce meaningful and compact clusters that accurately capture the structure of the dataset."

Furthermore, its applicability is limited to datasets where the mean is defined, raising challenges with categorical data. Additionally, K-Means requires the number of clusters (k) to be specified in advance, which can be a drawback, and it struggles with noisy data and outliers.

Jaccard similarity calculates the intersection over the union of two sets, often used for binary data or sets.

Each change corresponds to a certain number of points, and the total points represent the distance between the two objects. Similarly, the distance between Marge and Selma involves operations like changing dress color, adding earrings, decreasing height, taking up smoking, and losing weight. The edit distance provides a way to quantify similarity based on the extent of transformation required, facilitating comparison and analysis across diverse datasets."

This metric calculates the straight-line distance in a continuous feature space, assuming data features are continuous and numeric. However, K-means makes several key assumptions about the data: it assumes clusters are spherical and isotropic, have similar densities, and possess uniform variance across attributes. While K-means is effective when applied to datasets adhering to these assumptions, its performance may degrade if they are violated. Instances of irregularly shaped or non-linearly separable clusters, varying cluster densities, or disparate attribute variances can lead to suboptimal clustering outcomes. Hence, careful consideration of these assumptions is crucial when employing K-means clustering to ensure its appropriateness and effectiveness in capturing the underlying structure of the data."

Consequently, when employing Euclidean distance, it's essential to consider whether the data distribution conforms to its assumptions and whether alternative distance metrics might better capture the true relationships within the data. Careful consideration of these factors ensures the appropriate selection of distance metrics for clustering tasks, contributing to more accurate and meaningful clustering outcomes."

However, normalization is not always necessary or desirable; in some cases, the inherent scale of the data may contain important information.

It should also be robust to noise and outliers, maintaining stability and consistency across different runs or variations of the dataset.

In the context of clustering criteria, SSE serves as a measure of how well the clusters capture the inherent structure of the data.

However, in other scenarios, clusters of unequal sizes may be more reflective of the underlying structure of the data, especially if certain groups are naturally more prevalent or distinct. Additionally, the choice of clustering algorithm and its sensitivity to cluster size imbalance can influence performance.

Firstly, it is essential to select the features that will characterize the data and form the basis of the clustering process. These features should accurately represent the underlying structure of the dataset and capture the relevant patterns or relationships. Once the features are chosen, representative data must be collected, ensuring that the dataset is comprehensive and reflective of the problem domain. Subsequently, a suitable clustering algorithm must be selected based on the characteristics of the data and the goals of the analysis. Various algorithms, such as K-means or DBSCAN, offer different approaches to clustering and may perform differently depending on the dataset's properties. Finally, the number of clusters must be specified, either based on prior knowledge or through techniques such as elbow method or silhouette analysis, to guide the clustering process effectively. By following these steps, partitional clustering can be applied methodically and yield meaningful insights into the underlying structure of the data."

One approach involves leveraging cross-validation techniques to systematically evaluate different values of k and select the one that optimizes a chosen criterion, such as minimizing the Sum of Squared Error (SSE) or maximizing the Trace. However, this method may require careful consideration of the trade-offs between computational complexity and clustering quality. Alternatively, domain experts can be involved in the decision-making process by visually inspecting the clustering results and providing subjective feedback based on their domain knowledge. Presenting clustering outcomes in a clear and intuitive manner is crucial in facilitating expert evaluation. Finally, the knee solution, which involves plotting the SSE or other relevant criteria against the number of clusters and identifying the point where the rate of improvement begins to diminish significantly, can provide a heuristic for selecting an appropriate value of k. However, this method may not always yield a clear and unambiguous solution, requiring careful interpretation and consideration of additional factors."

It becomes difficult to identify true clusters amidst the high-dimensional space, often leading to increased computational complexity and reduced clustering accuracy. Moreover, the presence of irrelevant or redundant features exacerbates this problem by introducing noise and obscuring meaningful patterns in the data. Additionally, in high-dimensional spaces, all points tend to be equidistant, making it challenging to discern meaningful differences in proximity. To mitigate these challenges, various solutions can be employed, including dimension reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE), which reduce the dimensionality of the data while preserving its structure. Feature subset selection methods can also be utilized to identify and retain only the most relevant features for clustering. Another approach involves cluster ensembles using random projection, which will be discussed in later lectures, offering alternative strategies to address the complexities of clustering high-dimensional data."

Subsequently, each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, forming initial clusters. The algorithm then iterates by recalculating the centroids based on the mean of the data points within each cluster and reassigning data points to the cluster with the closest centroid. This process continues until convergence, where the cluster assignments no longer change significantly between iterations. K-means is effective for uncovering distinct clusters in data, but its performance can vary depending on the initial centroid placements and the choice of k. Additionally, it may converge to a local optimum, and the results can be sensitive to outliers. Nonetheless, k-means remains a widely used and efficient clustering algorithm for various applications."
